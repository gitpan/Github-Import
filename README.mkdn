# How do I use it?

    % cd some_project_in_git
    % github-import --username jrockway --password whatever --add-remote --push-mode all

You can also create a config file. Here is an example using a real man's editor:

    % cat > ~/.github-import
    ---
    username: jrockway
    password: ilovehellokitty
    remote:   origin # if you don't like "github"
    ^D
    % cd some_other_project_in_git
    % github-import
